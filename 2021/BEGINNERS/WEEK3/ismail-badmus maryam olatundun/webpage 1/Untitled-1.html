        <h1>Myself</h1>
        <p>I am Maryam Ismail-Badmus. I am a final year student of the department of Radiography, College of medicine, University of Lagos.</p>
        <p>I am passionate about helping others. I communicate effectively as it is essential for day to day activities as well as for better relationship with patients.</p>
        <p>I multitask effectively as the healthcare system can be a very busy environment. It is an attribute that is also important for daily life.</p>
        <p>I am an empathic and compassionate person as it has a positive impact on me, my patients and everyone around me in general.</p>
        <p class="text">I am willing to learn and broaden my scope of experience.</p>
        <p id="special">Thank you.</p>
